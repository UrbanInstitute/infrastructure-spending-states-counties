Similarly, contaminated water in aging lead pipes of older homes harms children of color at higher rates than white children.

Infrastructure</strong>: Infrastructure is an umbrella term used to describe elements of the built environment, though there is no single definition or use of the term.

For this project, we chose to expand that definition to housing, which is a key element of the built environment."},{"type":"text","value":"<strong>2. Equity</strong>: Equity means “the state, quality, or ideal of being just, impartial, and fair,” as defined by <a href=\"https://racc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/An-Introduction-to-Racial-Equity-Assessment-Tools.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Race Forward</a>. For this project, we focus on distributional equity across states and counties according to race, ethnicity, and economic class, meaning we look at which programs and policies result in a fair distribution of benefits and burdens across all segments of a community, prioritizing those with the highest needs. These distributions are, in part, the product of funding choices made by public officials, but it is worth emphasizing that achieving equitable outcomes depends on whether investments improve communities or degrade them. We do not measure these outcomes as a part of this project."},{"type":"text","value":"<strong>3. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA)</strong>: In November 2021, Congress passed this law, which will distribute $1.2 trillion through various funding programs between fiscal years 2022 and 2026 to rebuild American infrastructure and “invest in communities that have too often been left behind,” according to <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/06/fact-sheet-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/\" target=\"_blank\">the White House</a>. Throughout this project, we refer to the infrastructure law as IIJA; some officials refer to it as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, or BIL."},{"type":"text","value":"<strong>4. Formula grant</strong>: Formula grants are awarded to eligible entities based on funding formulas established by Congress or federal agencies, often based on population and other local characteristics. In some cases, these formulas were established by prior laws, and Congress has maintained funding levels to state and local jurisdictions based on those formulas without updating them to account for present conditions. Most formula grants are distributed to states, but some (such as Community Development Block Grants) are distributed to localities and others (such as Housing Choice Vouchers) are distributed to public agencies."},{"type":"text","value":"<strong>5. Competitive grant</strong>: Competitive, or discretionary, grants are awarded by federal departments after a request for proposals that invites applicants to submit ideas that meet federal priorities. Through competitive grant programs, governmental bodies, public agencies, and occasionally nonprofit and for-profit entities can apply for federal funding for specific programs or project ideas. Once received, applications are evaluated based on merit by a team of reviewers from the awarding agency."},{"type":"text","value":"<strong>6. Capacity</strong>: Capacity represents the extent to which municipal governments have the time, staff, and money to apply for and receive grants by developing compelling proposals.

We calculate this figure for staff working in transportation, housing and community development, and the environment, depending on the program."},{"type":"text","value":"<strong>7. Externalities</strong>: An externality is an outcome, effect, or consequence of some project or investment. Positive externalities are the planned or unplanned beneficial outcomes of some effort. Negative externalities are outcomes that cause harm (often referred to as “costs”). In the context of infrastructure work, negative externalities are often undesired byproducts of construction and facility use, such as the air pollution and traffic noise associated with highways. Each project funded by IIJA programs is likely to generate some amount of negative externalities that affect communities in the immediate vicinity of the project and in the surrounding regions. We describe a large number of these externalities for different project types in the appendix of Is Federal Infrastructure Investment Advancing Equity Goals?."},{"type":"text","value":"<strong>8. Need</strong>: We use the term “need” in two ways for this project. First, we use it in the context of community demographics, when referring to communities with high shares of people with low incomes and people of color, because we are interested in racial and economic equity considerations. Many of these communities have either historically received less investment or experienced more negative externalities from inequitable investment than whiter or more affluent communities. As such, these communities may have a greater need for investment today. Second, we use the term “need” in the context of programmatic indicators to describe jurisdictions that have a higher need related to a specific program; for example, jurisdictions with higher housing cost burdens might have a higher need for housing assistance."},{"type":"text","value":"<strong>9. Indicator(s)</strong>: Indicators are data points that align with programmatic need. As in the example above, one indicator for the “need” for housing investment is housing cost burden."},{"type":"text","value":"<strong>10. Per-capita measurements</strong>: Per-capita measurements calculate specific data <strong>per person</strong>. In this project, per-capita calculations typically represent data values per 1000 people; we note if otherwise. Per-capita measurements allow us to compare funding amounts across counties and states with different populations; for example, a county with 1,000,000 residents is likely to receive more funding overall than a county with 100,000 residents, but per-capita funding can more easily be compared between jurisdictions."},{"type":"text","value":"<h2>About the Data</h2>"},{"type":"text","value":"For this tool, we analyzed (1) 58 unique grant programs funded by IIJA that will each distribute a total of at least $1 billion between fiscal years 2022 and 2026 and (2) eight housing programs each distributing at least $1 billion in 2022 through annual HUD appropriations.

For example, we would classify a grant awarded to the Chicago Transit Authority to Cook County and Illinois."},{"type":"text","value":"When possible, we visualize indicators and programmatic data at the county level. Project funds occasionally cover multiple counties. In these cases, we assume that funds are spread out evenly across these counties. The federal government distributed some awards directly to state governments for projects whose geographies were not yet defined. In these cases, we include awarded funds in state and program totals, but not at the county level.

Demographic indicators include characteristics such as population density, share of residents who are people of color, and median household income. Program-related need indicators include broadband speed, number of public transit stops, share of vacant housing units, and share of bridges in poor condition, among others.

But these indicators do not always tell a clear story. We use <em>miles of major roads and highways (per capita per square mile)</em>, for example, as one way to evaluate transportation programs. Places that have more roads might need high levels of transportation funding to help maintain those roads, but places with fewer roads might also have a high need for funding to build new roads and connect communities that currently lack transportation options."},{"type":"text","value":"How a program distributes funding depends on the processes and people in charge of making funding decisions.

A score of 0 indicates that the jurisdiction’s funding is proportional to the indicator. A negative score indicates the jurisdiction is receiving less funding than its indicator value would imply; a positive score indicates the jurisdiction is receiving more funding than its indicator value would imply. For example, if a county was at the 40th percentile for the funding it received from the Bridge Formula Program, but in the 70th percentile of need for its share of bridges that are in disrepair, that county would have an equity metric of –0.3 for that program and indicator combination.

A score of 0 indicates that jurisdictions accounting for the top 25 percent of the US population, ranked based on a given indicator, receive roughly 25 percent of the funding. A lower score means that these jurisdictions receive less than 25 percent of the funding, and a higher score means that these jurisdictions receive more than 25 percent of the funding. For example, if a program has a county-level concentration score of 1 when measured in terms of share of people of color, that would mean that the program distributes about 50 percent of its funding to the quarter of the population living in counties with the highest shares of people of color.</li><li>The <strong>high-need equity measure</strong> shows, on median, how close high-need jurisdictions are to receiving a level of funding that would meet their need, as indicated by a specific indicator (e.g., share of residents of color). High-need jurisdictions are those above the 50th percentile for the given indicator. We calculate this measure for each program and relevant indicator combination. In other words, this measure shows the median equity metric (described above) for the jurisdictions in the top 50th percentile of need. Paired with the concentration measure, this measure indicates whether high-need jurisdictions are receiving progressively more funding than lower-need jurisdictions. Scores range from –1 to 1, with negative values signifying that the median high-need jurisdiction is receiving less funding than its indicator value, and positive values signifying that the median high-need jurisdiction is receiving more funding than its indicator value. The nature of this high-need measure makes it very difficult to achieve a positive score. You can use this measure’s distance from zero to understand how close programs are to progressively meeting need in terms of a particular indicator. If a program has a high-need equity score of –0.2 for median household income, that would mean that the median equity metric for counties in the top 50th percentile for need is –0.2. This number could mean, for example, that the median high-need county is at the 50th percentile for program funding, but at the 70th percentile for median household income.</li><li>The <strong>variability measure</strong> indicates the degree to which a program’s per-capita funding aligns with the nation’s overall per-capita funding. A variability score of 0 means that the program’s state-level funding distribution is similar to the national distribution. A higher variability score indicates that the state-level funding distribution for that program is farther from the national distribution, in either direction. Scores for most programs fall between 0 and 10. A program having a score of 8, for example, might mean that the typical state is receiving either much higher or much lower per-capita funding than would be true if funding were spread evenly across the country. This metric is relevant for formula programs only, in which large amounts of funding are distributed to all states.</li></ul>"},{"type":"text","value":"There is no such thing as a “perfect” measure.
